I am **Sucheth Shenoy**, a Master’s student in **Mechatronics (Robotics and Intelligent Systems)** at the **Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)**. I have recently completed my Master’s thesis at **EPFL, Switzerland**, and I am currently in the final stage of my Master’s degree.

My interests lie at the intersection of **robotics, learning, and control**, with a focus on understanding how learning-based methods can be designed to be **reliable, interpretable, and theoretically grounded**. I am particularly interested in questions of **stability, robustness, and generalization** in reinforcement learning, and in how ideas from classical control theory can inform modern learning-based approaches for real-world systems.

Broadly, my work is motivated by the gap between the impressive empirical performance of modern learning methods and the stronger guarantees typically required for safety-critical or physically grounded systems. I am drawn to research that combines **theory and practice**, aiming to develop methods that are both principled and applicable to real robotic platforms.

Alongside my academic work, I have experience in applied research and engineering roles in both industrial and research-oriented settings. These experiences have shaped my interest in problems that sit at the boundary between **theoretical development and real-world deployment**, and in translating abstract ideas into systems that work reliably outside of controlled environments.

Outside of research, I am an avid **table tennis player** and enjoy playing the **piano**, which provides a creative balance to my technical interests. I also enjoy snooker, chess, bouldering, and traveling, especially to places that combine natural landscapes with cultural depth.
