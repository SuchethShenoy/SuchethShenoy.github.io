Biography
======
I’m Sucheth Shenoy, a graduate student in Mechatronics at the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH), specializing in Intelligent Systems and Robotics. I am currently pursuing my Master’s thesis at EPFL, Switzerland, supported by the NCCR Automation Fellowship. My research interests lie at the intersection of robotics, reinforcement learning, and control theory, with a particular focus on bridging the gap between performance and theoretical guarantees in learning-based control, especially as applied to real-world robotic systems.

My broader research experience spans three key areas:

1. **Robotics**  
I have worked extensively on robotic systems with a focus on real-world deployment and control. My experience includes developing reinforcement learning strategies for quadruped locomotion, implementing gait generation and step-climbing behaviors on the Petoi Bittle platform. I am a co-inventor on a design patent for a robotic end-effector for selective tea leaf harvesting and contributed to the design of Mars rover prototypes that competed in international challenges such as the URC and ERC. I have also worked on 3D point-cloud-based navigation system for robotic needle placement using the Franka Emika Panda arm.

2. **Control**  
My background includes coursework and project work in optimal control, nonlinear systems, and system identification. I developed an autoencoder-based system identification method for Koopman operator-based predictive control, accepted for presentation at the 2025 American Control Conference (ACC). I also served as a student tutor for the Control Systems course at TUHH, where I led exercise classes and supported students in understanding classical and modern control techniques.

3. **Learning**  
My central research interest lies in learning-based control algorithms that are both high-performing and theoretically grounded. At EPFL, I am currently working on my Master’s thesis on Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Control with Stability Guarantees. This work, supported by the NCCR Automation Fellowship, has led to a novel policy parameterization approach and a preprint submission to the Conference on Decision and Control (CDC 2025). Earlier, I published work on human action recognition using pose estimation at a CVPR Workshop and contributed to a regional-winning project in the OpenCV AI Competition, where we developed a multi-camera system for sports analytics.

Alongside my academic journey, I have gained industry experience in both research and applied engineering roles. As a working student at Vilisto GmbH, I worked on data science, data engineering, and system identification projects supporting the development of smart thermostats for energy-efficient buildings. Previously, at Bosch Limited, I served as a technical management trainee, where I contributed to engine control strategies and predictive diagnostics for automotive systems, including a patent-pending model for filter clogging and remaining useful life estimation of an exhaust-treatment system. These experiences have reinforced my interest in bridging theoretical research with practical, real-world applications.

Outside of academics, I am a passionate table tennis player, formerly ranked at the national level in India. I also enjoy playing classical piano, which offers a creative balance to my technical pursuits. In my free time, I explore interests in snooker, chess, and bouldering. I enjoy traveling and trekking, often seeking out places that offer a mix of nature and cultural depth.
