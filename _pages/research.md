My research interests lie at the intersection of **robotics, learning, and control**, with a focus on developing learning-based methods that are reliable, interpretable, and theoretically grounded. I am particularly interested in how ideas from classical control theory can inform modern learning-based approaches for real-world systems.

Rather than viewing learning and control as separate paradigms, I am motivated by research that **bridges empirical performance with formal guarantees**, especially in safety-critical or physically grounded domains. My work is driven by the question of how learning-based controllers can be designed to exhibit predictable, stable, and robust behavior beyond empirical validation.

## Research Themes

### Learning-Based Control with Guarantees
I am interested in reinforcement learning and adaptive control methods that explicitly incorporate **stability, robustness, and performance guarantees**. This includes the use of structured policy representations, constraint-aware learning formulations, and control-theoretic tools to guide or regularize learning-based controllers.

A central motivation in this theme is to move beyond purely black-box learning and toward approaches where **theoretical structure plays an active role** in shaping learning dynamics and controller behavior.

### Robustness and Generalization
A recurring theme in my research is understanding how learning-based controllers behave under **uncertainty, model mismatch, and distributional shift**. I am particularly interested in robustness notions that go beyond empirical testing, including worst-case and distributionally robust perspectives.

This line of work aims to improve the reliability of learning-based systems when deployed outside carefully controlled training environments.

### System Identification and Dynamics Learning
I am interested in data-driven approaches for modeling dynamical systems, especially methods that combine learning with structure. This includes latent-space models, operator-theoretic approaches, and hybrid learning–model-based pipelines that enable efficient prediction and control of nonlinear systems.

I am particularly drawn to approaches that preserve interpretability and enable downstream control design.

### Hierarchical Learning and Structured Skill Representations
I am interested in hierarchical and structured approaches to learning for control, where complex behaviors are composed from simpler, reusable skills. This includes learning and leveraging **motor primitives**, **options**, and other forms of temporal abstraction to improve scalability, interpretability, and generalization in reinforcement learning.

A key motivation in this theme is to introduce **structure and inductive bias** into learning-based controllers, enabling high-level decision-making over meaningful skill representations while low-level controllers handle fast dynamics and physical constraints. I am especially interested in how such hierarchical formulations can interface with classical control and stability analysis.

### Robotics Applications
I am broadly interested in applying learning and control methods to **robotic systems**, including legged locomotion and manipulation. I am particularly drawn to problems where physical constraints, partial observability, and real-world deployment challenges play a central role, and where theoretical considerations meaningfully impact system performance and reliability.
