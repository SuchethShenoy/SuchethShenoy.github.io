**Abstract**  
This patent application presents a method for training machine learning based models to estimate the remaining useful life of filters in auomotive exhaust after-treatment systems. By combining sensor data with data-driven modeling, the approach enables early detection of filter degradation and predictive maintenance. The method aims to improve system reliability and reduce operational costs in automotive and industrial exhaust-treatment applications.
